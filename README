     use Moose;
     use Catalyst::Controller::Accessors;

     use namespace::autoclean;

     BEGIN { extends 'Catalyst::Controller' };

     cat_has user => (

       namespace => 'MyApp::Controller::Users',
     );

     cat_has $_ => ( is => 'rw' ) for qw(resultset thing);

     sub load_rs {
       my ($self, $c) = @_;

       $self->resultset($c,
          $self->user($c)->roles
       );
     }

     sub load_thing {
       my ($self, $c, $id) = @_;

       $self->thing($c,
          $self->resultset($c)->find($id)
       );
     }

DESCRIPTION
    The overall idea for this module is to allow more sensible access to the
    stash. It merely namespaces the stash based on the name of the
    controller adding the accessor or the specified namespace. It's prime
    purpose is for chaining.

IMPORTED SUBROUTINES
  cat_has
    Options:

    *
     "is" - required, must be either "ro" or "rw"

    *
     "namespace" - defaults to current controller
